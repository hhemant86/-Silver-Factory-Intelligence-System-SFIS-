To reach that €110k/year or ₹80+ LPA target, your README cannot look like a "student project." It must look like Institutional-Grade Documentation.

It needs to speak the language of Capital Efficiency, Forensic Auditing, and Risk Mitigation. Here is the professional README for your new repository.

🏭 Silver Factory Intelligence System (SFIS)
Industrial ERP & Capital Risk Operating System
A high-integrity, Python-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed for the precious metals manufacturing industry. This system treats physical silver as a liquid capital asset, tracking its transformation from raw mixed-purity ingots to high-precision finished goods with zero-leakage forensic auditing.

🎯 Project Objective
The SFIS is engineered to solve the "Opaque Loss" problem in silver manufacturing. Unlike standard accounting software, this system uses Quantitative Operational Intelligence to:

Audit Physical Capital: Track every gram of silver through a 10-stage manufacturing loop.

Dynamic Parameterization: Implement a "Zero-Fixed-Value" architecture where lab samples, labor rates, and wastage benchmarks are fully configurable.

Forensic Anomaly Detection: Identify "Wastage Variance" between actual production loss and statistical benchmarks.

Liquidation Intelligence: Manage silver-to-cash conversion for operational overhead (Salaries, Electricity, Commissions) based on live market spot prices.

🏗️ System Architecture
1. The Atomic Ledger
State-Transition Tracking: Moves metal through Melting, Drawing, Ujjal, Soldering, and Electrolysis.

Mass-Balance Enforcement: Ensures (Input Weight = Output Weight + Sample Loss + Scrap + Process Loss).

2. Dynamic Config Engine
Nothing is Fixed: Every industrial constant (e.g., the 1g Ingot Lab Rule or 4g Rod Lab Rule) is stored in a relational settings vault, allowing the business to pivot instantly without code changes.

3. Scrap & Yield Management
Bifurcated Scrap Vaults: Separate tracking for High-Purity (Chillai) and General Process scrap.

Melt-Trigger Logic: Automated alerts when scrap containers hit industrial thresholds.

📊 Technical Stack
Backend: FastAPI (Asynchronous Python)

ORM/Database: SQLAlchemy & PostgreSQL (SQLite for local dev)

Validation: Pydantic V2 (Strict type enforcement)

Analytics: NumPy & Pandas (Feature logging for future ML)

📈 Roadmap to AI Integration
Phase 1 (Active): Deterministic Ledger & Operational Logic.

Phase 2: Karigar (Artisan) Trust Scoring & Anomaly Flagging.

Phase 3: Predictive Wastage Modeling using 3-Sigma Statistical Filtering (Porting logic from XAU Risk Quant Engine).
